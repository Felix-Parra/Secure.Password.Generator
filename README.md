# Secure.Password.Generator
Helps generate a password for anything!

For this project I created a webpage that will generate random passwords for any use while using Javascript. I used multiple different Javascript techniques to create this webpage for example window.promt, window.alert, window.confirm, etc. I created multiple window.confirm promts for the user to include any characters they wish to put in their password, It gives them a more personalized password of their liking.
